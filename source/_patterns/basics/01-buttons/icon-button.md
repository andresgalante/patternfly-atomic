## Overview

A button containing an icon is used as part of the [Patternfly toolbar](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/toolbar/#_design) and in other places.

Add a modifier class to add color to the button, adjust the size, or to change to a transparent button.

## Accessibility

Always include `aria-labelledby` if text is not included in the button.

## Usage

No unique classes for this pattern. See button and icon patterns for customization.
